About NHRO : <br>
Since eons, civilization has progressed through several junctures before coming to this super advanced digital age.
Sadly, what continue to remain ingrained in our society today are discrimination, oppression, crime and violation.
Every human being is born with certain inherent rights, irrespective of gender, age, colour, religion or nationality.
Those birth rights enable individuals to live with dignity, freedom and equality. 
However, the vulnerable population is made to suffer in various ways, thus, challenging humanity.<br>
